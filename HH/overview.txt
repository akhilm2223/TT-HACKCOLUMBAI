Break Point
Performance & Mental Intelligence for Single-Sport Athletes
 WHAT BREAK POINT IS
Break Point is a data-driven performance and mental analysis system designed for single-sport athletes.  It focuses on the moments that decide matches — high-pressure points where hesitation, fear, or poor decisions silently change outcomes.
Break Point analyzes match behavior, detects performance breakdowns under pressure, and provides clear, opponent-specific corrections so athletes can perform at their best when it matters most.
 WHY THE NAME “BREAK POINT”
In racket sports, a break point represents the most mentally demanding moment in a match.  It is where pressure peaks, confidence is tested, and outcomes are decided.
This name directly reflects what the product does: - Identifies pressure moments - Exposes invisible mental and behavioral breakdowns - Helps athletes respond decisively instead of playing safe
 WHAT PROBLEM BREAK POINT SOLVES
Single-sport athletes do not have access to analysts or mental performance staff. They are forced to self-diagnose after losses and often repeat the same mistakes against the same opponents.
Break Point solves this by: - Detecting when a player’s behavior changes under pressure - Showing why the change happened - Giving one concrete adjustment for the next match
 WHO IT IS FOR
Break Point is built for: - Competitive table tennis, tennis, badminton, squash players - Intermediate to advanced athletes - League, tournament, junior, college, and serious amateur competitors
It is not designed for casual players.  It is for athletes who care about winning, improvement, and consistency under pressure.
 WHY USERS WILL PAY
Competitive athletes already spend money on: - Coaching - Equipment - Training and tournaments - Analytics tools
Break Point fits naturally into this ecosystem by replacing guesswork with clarity. Athletes pay to stop losing matches they should be winning and to gain an analytical edge they otherwise cannot afford.
 WHY BREAK POINT IS DIFFERENT
Break Point is not a motivational app and not just an analytics tool.
It combines: - Match behavior analysis - Pressure-point detection - Opponent pattern recognition - Mental and tactical correction
Instead of telling athletes to “stay confident,” Break Point shows exactly what changed, why it mattered, and what to do differently next time.
 SUMMARY
Break Point gives single-sport athletes what team-sport athletes already have: structured analysis, strategic insight, and clarity under pressure.
It focuses on the moments that decide matches — and helps athletes win them.
